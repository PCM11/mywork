This dataset is available for more exploration [on Github](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

## About the data

The [Palmer penguins Dataset](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/) by Allison Horst, Alison Hill and Dr Kristen Gorman contains data for 344 adult penguins of 3 different species (Adelie, Gentoo and Chinstrap), from 3 differrent islands (Biscoe, Torgeesen and Dream) in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

It contains two datasets, one called *penguins* and the other called *penguins_raw*.

*Penguin* is a simplified version of the raw data,and more information can be found [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins.html).

*Penguin Raw* includes nesting observations, penguin size data, and isotope measurements from blood samples for adult Ad√©lie, Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins.
More details can be found [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/penguins_raw.html)

## Usage

It provides a rich dataset for exploration and visualisation of data, offering an alternative to a highly over used Iris dataset.
