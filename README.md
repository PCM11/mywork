# My Work


## About This Project
This dataset was created by Allison Horst, Alison Hill, Dr Kristen Gorman at the Palmer Station in Antarctica. 
It was collected from 344 adult penguins and includes the measurements for penguin species, islands in Palmer 
Archipelago, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions), and sex.

This dataset is available for more exploration [on Github](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/).

## Use of This Project
The Palmerpenguin dataset provide a rich dataset for exploration and visualisation of data, offering an alternative to a highhy over used Iris dataset.


## Get Started
I used [openincolab.com](https://openincolab.com/) to generate the following clickable link.
It opens the `penguins.ipynb` notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

</a>

To further explore this dataset you need to download python, which can be installed through [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), and notebook editor, which can be found in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
